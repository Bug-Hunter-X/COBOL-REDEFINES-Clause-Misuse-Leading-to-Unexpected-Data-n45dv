This example demonstrates a potential error when using the REDEFINES clause in COBOL.  The program moves a value to WS-FIELD-1, which is part of a structure defined using REDEFINES.  The output shows that even though a value is assigned to WS-FIELD-1, it may not be correctly reflected when accessing WS-AREA-1 depending on the compiler and memory alignment. This is because  REDEFINES simply allows two or more data structures to share the same storage area, it does not change data types or ensure data alignment across the different definitions. Data type mismatch or misalignment might result in incorrect data read or display.
